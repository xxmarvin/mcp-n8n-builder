# mcp-n8n-builder

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for programmatic creation and
management of n8n workflows. This server provides tools and resources
for interacting with n8n's REST API, allowing AI assistants to build,
modify, and manage workflows without direct user intervention.

## Features

- 🔄 **Workflow Management**: Create, read, update, delete, activate,
  and deactivate workflows
- 📊 **Execution Management**: List and retrieve workflow execution
  details

## MCP Tools

### Node Management

- `list_available_nodes`: Lists all available nodes in the n8n
  instance. **IMPORTANT**: Use this tool BEFORE creating or updating
  workflows to ensure you only use valid node types. This helps
  prevent errors caused by using node types that don't exist in the
  current n8n instance.

### Workflow Management

- `list_workflows`: Lists all workflows from n8n with their basic
  information including ID, name, status, creation date, and tags.
  Results can be filtered by active status, tags, or name.
- `create_workflow`: Creates a new workflow in n8n with specified
  nodes and connections. Returns the created workflow with its
  assigned ID. Validates that all node types exist in the n8n
  instance.
- `get_workflow`: Retrieves complete details of a specific workflow by
  its ID, including all nodes, connections, settings, and metadata.
- `update_workflow`: Updates an existing workflow with new
  configuration. The entire workflow structure must be provided, not
  just the parts being changed. Validates that all node types exist in
  the n8n instance.
- `delete_workflow`: Permanently deletes a workflow by its ID. This
  action cannot be undone.
- `activate_workflow`: Activates a workflow by its ID, enabling it to
  run automatically based on its trigger.
- `deactivate_workflow`: Deactivates a workflow by its ID, preventing
  it from running automatically.

### Execution Management

- `list_executions`: Lists workflow execution history with details on
  success/failure status, duration, and timestamps. Results can be
  filtered by workflow ID, status, and limited to a specific number.
- `get_execution`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific
  workflow execution, including execution time, status, and optionally
  the full data processed at each step.

## MCP Resources

- `n8n://workflows`: List of all workflows in n8n
- `n8n://workflows/{id}`: Details of a specific n8n workflow
- `n8n://executions/{id}`: Details of a specific n8n workflow
  execution

   npm install -g mcp-n8n-builder
   ```

3. Create a configuration file for Claude Desktop App:
   Create a file named `config.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "n8n-workflow-builder": {
         "command": "bash",
         "args": [
           "-c",
           "N8N_HOST=http://localhost:5678/api/v1 N8N_API_KEY=your-n8n-api-key OUTPUT_VERBOSITY=concise npx -y mcp-n8n-builder"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Update the configuration in Claude Desktop App:
   - Open Claude Desktop App
   - Go to Settings
   - Navigate to "Advanced"
   - Upload or paste the configuration JSON
